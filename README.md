# BreakoutGame
A simple clone of the game Breakout (1976) built using C

The majority of this code was wrritten by Peter Eberhard. However, parts of key files contain code belonging to others that I do not have permission to post here. If any potential employers are interested in seeing hidden code or demoing the game I'm more than willing to show if you send me a message.
